# Lab_4-6_UCU_CS_2022
Misclicked with my 4_5 project. If you need it, go here : https://github.com/Dima-Vas/Lab_4-5_UCU_CS_2022

A simple game for my 4_6 laboratory. Trying to use classes properly.

A description : 
A five-stage game in which you should get away from Sykhiv district for a while. Fool, scare and beat random marginal elements trying to make something bad with you : it's all for the lifestyle you choose at the beginning.

Components :

setup.py module :
- sets classes of Characters
- sets classes of Items
- sets classes of Stages

main.py module :
- supervises the workflow of a program : 
- - supervises fights
- - supervises trading
- - supervises getting to the next stages

Usage :
To use the program properly, import setup.py into main.py (should both be positioned in the same folder) if it isn't.
Use console to input commands (mostly numbers like 0 or 1 or words like Stick etc. More info will be given throughout the playing). 

Contributing : 
Contributing is particularly allowed. Dima-Vas can always declare to be the owner of your product.

Nuances :
- Could have written more complicated combat system. Hoping to manage to in a few days.
